It all began with a solitary poem, an<br>

from 1988 by Yo Nakajima.<br>
We see a hand,<br>
touching (barely) with the tip of the fingers,<br>
with an outstretched palm,<br>
winter landscapes, <br>
certain objects...<br>
Aprehender con la punta de los dedos.<br>
From this encounter, which moves silently<br>
‚Äîlike a ghost in a conversation‚Äî<br>
we recreate this gesture with a dedication to<br>
the other<a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/3 (_)-01.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="../assets/6Apostrophe_LackOfTouch.png">,<a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/8 (resistance)-01.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src=""> <br>

<br><br>
Conspire.<br>
Maybe without a plot, but always with others.<br>
Not necessarily for others, but with others. <br>
From this gesture of touching/not touching, murmurs then arise with two others and the two of us in this project that has been going on for some time now.<br>
Two others are added to the two that are one. <br>
and we became<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a four-headed serpent.<br>
A serpent with four heads <a class="readinglink"><img class="icon" src="../assets/1 About.svg" ></a>

<br><br>
****
<br><br>
The process of creating and translating images as a self that is part of other-selves is similar to the operation of immersing oneself in a strong current river‚Äî un rio de caudal fuerte.
<br><br>
At first, when one partially enters the river, one tries to speak, shouting, in an effort to distinguish oneself. But one's own voice is indistinguishable in its deafening roar. It is necessary to listen for a while to the noise of the river, to let it stun, to let it saturate. Allow yourself to feel its flow, its rhythm, and its direction. To merge into it. 
Where does its voice go? How does it sound? What advice does it bring? (the latter being the most difficult to listen to).
When this sound manages to drown out one's own voice, when the noise of the flow and the cold of the water almost take possession of one's own body, that is when one submerges completely. <a class="readinglink"><img class="icon" src="../assets/7 (mutualism)-01.svg"></a>
<img class="readingimg hover" src="">It is when one surrenders to its strength. 
<br><br>
Submerged, the vertiginous noise of the river becomes more nuanced, and one's own voice takes shape. Curiously, the density of the environment makes it possible to discern between the voices with clarity and reveals the harmony between the external voice and the internal voice <a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/3 (_)-01.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="../assets/6Apostrophe_LackOfTouch.png"><a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/4 (intuitive)-01.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="">.
<br><br>
Submerged, the flow and direction become more precise, but not as mental clarity, not as solid knowledge. It is more as a sensation, a pulsion. When coming out of the water, like waking from a dream, the clarity disperses, but a slight sensation in the pit of the stomach remains. You've been there, you've heard it, you've known it. So it is not a surprise when, later, you hear the faint murmur of the river again as a distant sound that calls (sensory memory). Even the body feels the shock as it touches the icy water (body memory). The sound marks a flow and a path, the rush of the current signals marks that it is time to move on. The advice becomes evident, and the solutions materialise as we go on. 
<br><br>
The process of constructing and translating images is also a process of assuming the selves (the noise of the river - the external voices) into the self (one's own voice).<a class="readinglink"><img class="icon" src="../assets/7 (mutualism)-01.svg"></a>
<img class="readingimg hover" src=""> I listen, I understand, I create, I communicate. 
<br><br>
The mercurian work of transmitting a message.

<br><br><br>
As four distant bodies <a class="readinglink"><img class="icon" src="../assets/1 About.svg" ></a>
<img class="readingimg hover" src="">, <br>
	we became a metaphorical being. 
We share a body, we have four heads. <br>
We are more than one, other than the one of the individual, and other than the one of the collective.<br>
<br><br>
We moved from the hands to the action of reading together, reading each other, reading what the other has already read <a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/13 SharedReadings.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="">, and leaving signs in the texts we were sending each other. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another form of touch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of touching each other.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being this being with four heads, and no hands,<br>
we became something like an informal study group from the first exercise of closeness. That studies<br>
about feeling, <br>
about inhabiting distance, <br>
about building bridges, <br>
about reaffirming absence, <br>
about impossibility, <br>
instability, <br>
displacement, <br>
delay.<br>
<br><br>
touching at a distance.<br>
touching in spite of distance.<br>
<br><br>
A fuerza de querernos cerca,<br>
a fuerza de desafiar la imposibilidad del tacto,<br>
a esa serpiente metaf√≥rica de cuatro cabezas <a class="readinglink"><img class="icon" src="../assets/1 About.svg" ></a>
<img class="readingimg hover" src="">, <br>
a veces le salen brazos, ocho brazos,<br>
y comprende con la punta de los dedos,<br>
deja rastros con sus manos.<br>
deja marcas en sus textos.<br>
Ocho manos dejan<br>
gu√≠as a las otras cabezas.<br>
Instrucciones para moverse <br>
en r√≠os de caudal fuerte.<br>
<br><br><br><br>

<br><br><br><br>
At first, I thought I was underlining for<br>
myself ‚Äîfor my future self <a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/3 (_)-01.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="../assets/6Apostrophe_LackOfTouch.png">, as I once read in an article‚Äî I took each of my books, as I read them, and underlined in them what I wanted to highlight, to remember later, when I no longer had any record of having read them before <a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/3 (_)-01.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="../assets/6Apostrophe_LackOfTouch.png">. To some phrases and verses, I drew sparkles ‚Äî I thought what I was reading was brilliant; to others, hearts‚Äî I felt pangs as my mouth advanced in my reading; to very few, I made comments ‚Äî almost always laughter, admitting another emotion.
<br><br>
My way of underlining is not a line, not dots in a row; they are waves, like those of some rivers (r√≠os de caudal fuerte). These waves are the movement of my body and how the texts move me <a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/13 SharedReadings.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="">‚Äî they make me vibrate, shake me, and make me restless. In a notebook, I make a list of all my underlines, transcribe them, and repeat with my hands the route my eyes have already taken <a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/3 (_)-01.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="../assets/6Apostrophe_LackOfTouch.png">; this is touch <a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/3 (_)-01.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="../assets/12 LowFrecuencies.svg"><a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/3 (_)-01.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="">, another form of touch. This list is also an abbreviation of the book. It is not a summary; it is a representative version. They are capsules of time, of mine, of the past. That's more or less how it is when it's about me. Not anymore, now there are four of us, and we share these records. I read, underline, scan, and send the files to the others. They do the same for me <a class="readinglink"><img class="icon" src="../assets/7 (mutualism)-01.svg"></a>
<img class="readingimg hover" src="">. I read, this time their underlines; I suspect the emotions, I wonder why those words are marked. When we coincide - this happens often - I smile; it is a coincidence to meet in this space that is also the text. That is to say, inside, in the text, we are close -again the illusion of closeness-. 
<br><br>
The result of reading each text four times is a new text, also scanned, on which there is the map <a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/13 SharedReadings.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src=""> of our readings, a common, collective map, which gives an account of our affections. This text is evidence that we are in the same place. Or we choose to believe so.

Between the hands that pretend to touch through the screen, the text that is a common map-intertwined rivers, and the words that are not heard underwater, something was and is still lost. We have asked ourselves what it is and what it is like, and no answer is precise. We changed the question: how can we give form to the loss, to the absence? If it is not seen, if we only have the presentiment <a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/3 (_)-01.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="../assets/6Apostrophe_LackOfTouch.png">, the sensation, it is not there. The low frequencies of that, what we don't know how to name yet, we feel. We all agree. Low frequencies, is how we decided to call the new-another rehearsal of contact, of affection. We met one day - which was morning in Colombia, and an afternoon in Switzerland, at the same time - and we recorded one of the screens while we speculated who and how it was that that was not there. For that, we had a question, the input, the trigger, a voice that asked us if we were still here, behind the screens, in this text that is being put together in four voices. Yes, yes, yes, yes, we all answered, and then, going off on a tangent, expanding the trajectory of the collective body, we began to make different confessions about absence. Here, touching a part of our body, we said something was missing. There, pointing to the idea of an imaginary space, we agreed that something was no longer there. The conversation was filled with silence. The frequencies varied according to the vividness of the memory, sometimes minimal, weak. The chat closed when the frequency became imperceptible. The recording of our messages and the delayed transmission of that conversation is the negative space of absence; we surround it, eight arms around it, we contain it: in the center is that which we still don't know how to name, which we can't describe, which can't be heard underwater either.

apostrophhheee as an interface is the window for those estranged from these four selves, <a class="readinglink"><img class="icon" src="../assets/1 About.svg" ></a>
<img class="readingimg hover" src=""> from this multiplicity creature. It constitutes the place where other others can access and view these compilations of closeness.  
<br><br>
There is beauty in containing an infinity on a screen -resizable but not responsive-, in looking at oneself in the reflection of a black mirror, in sharing (alone) the same experience as other people, in accessing a apos<br>
 vast amount of places and times <a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/20 (fragmented presence)-01.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="../assets/4Apostrophe_Presence_Distance.png">, in <br>
being an online presence <a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/3 (_)-01.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="../assets/6Apostrophe_LackOfTouch.png">, in being <br>
available to others, in becoming public, in feeling vulnerable, in welcoming others, in becoming emotion with each modification of the source code <a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/13 SharedReadings.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="">, in occupying and inhabiting an architecture for the mind that reverberates in bodies and fits on a laptop.
<br><br>
In this portal, apostrophhheee of absences and closeness, layers of affection are added from time to time, in the form of sets of draggable icons, which emit warmth and shadow when pointed at <a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/13 SharedReadings.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="">, which generate a map of the affections contained here, and which register acts of closeness in new windows <a class="readinglink"> <img class="icon" src="../assets/15 SharedReadings.svg"> </a> <img class="readingimg hover" src="">. <br>
An unfolding affection.
<br><br>
A negotiation of distances <a class="readinglink"><img class="icon" src="../assets/7 (mutualism)-01.svg"></a>
